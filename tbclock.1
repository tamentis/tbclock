.SH NAME
tbclock \- binary clock with some fun features

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B tbclock
[-v] [-b] [-f] [-d] [-a] [-H] [-m module]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B tbclock
is a command line clock that displays time in a binary form. Type Ctrl-C
at any time to quit. It features a few modules and games to play with 
binary time. By default the lines are horizontal and shows hours, minutes
and seconds, you can switch to a different behaviour with -a, see below.
.PP
The following command line options are available:
.TP
.B -v
Display version information.
.TP
.B -f
By default, if the terminal is big enough,
.B tbclock
draws a frame around the terminal with its version in the top-right corner.
This option disable this behavior.
.TP
.B -b
By default, if the terminal is big enough,
.B tbclock
draws a little space between each blocks to ease the reading, use this
switch to disable this little space.
.TP
.B -d
Do not display the dots where the bit is NUL on the clock.
.TP
.B -a
Switch 
.B tbclock
to display binary times in a different fashion, easier for some people,
one line per 'decimal digit' and vertical.
.TP
.B -H
Switch 
.B tbclock
to display decimal helpers. One -H will display side help, -HH will display
a decimal clock under the binary clock, -HHH will display both. You can
alternatively use the 'h' key to switch between modes.
.TP
.B -m <module>
.B tbclock
features games and tools related to binary clock reading, each module will
have its own keyboard bindings, check in the next section for more
information.

.SH MODULES
.TP
.B clock
This is the default module, it displays the current time. The 'h' key
will switch between different decimal hint modes. Any other key will
quit.
.TP
.B chrono
This module will run a timer from 0 to whatever you need. You can press
the Spacebar at any time to pause the timer, and BackSpace to reset it. Any
other key will quit. This module has an extra binary line that shows tenth
of seconds, this might makes some slow terminal flicker. 'h' key will
switch on/off different reading helps.
.TP
.B guessbin
This game displays a binary time and ask you its decimal equivalent. To
answer you have to fill the time in this form : "HH:MM:SS". The difficulty
only changes the answer delay and the amount of points you get. This module
is not affected by -f, -b or -H.
