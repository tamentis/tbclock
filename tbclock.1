.SH NAME
tbclock \- binary clock with some fun features

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B tbclock
[-abdefvh] [-HMST color] [-m module]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B tbclock
is a fullscreen terminal clock that displays time in a binary fashion or
another. It features a few modules and games to play with binary
displayed time. By default the lines are horizontal and shows hours,
minutes and seconds, you can switch to a different behaviour with -a,
see below.
.PP
The options are as follows:
.TP
.B -v
Display version information.
.TP
.B -f
By default, if the terminal is big enough,
.B tbclock
draws a frame around the terminal with its version in the top-right corner.
This option disable this behavior.
.TP
.B -b
By default, if the terminal is big enough,
.B tbclock
draws a little space between each blocks to ease the reading, use this
switch to disable this little space.
.TP
.B -d
Do not display the dots where the bit is NUL on the clock.
.TP
.B -a
Switch 
.B tbclock
to display binary times in a different fashion, easier for some people,
one line per 'decimal digit' and vertical.
.TP
.B -e
Switch 
.B tbclock
to display decimal helpers. One -H will display side help, -HH will display
a decimal clock under the binary clock, -HHH will display both. You can
alternatively use the 'h' key to switch between modes.
.TP
.B -m <module>
.B tbclock
features games and tools related to binary clock reading, each module will
have its own keyboard bindings, check in the next section for more
information.
.TP
.B -H, -M, -S, -T <color>
Those options changes the color of blocks. It takes a numeric option between
0 and 7, those numbers are directly copied from ncurses.h, here are their
meaning :
     0: Black         4: Blue
     1: Red           5: Magenta
     2: Green         6: Cyan
     3: Yellow        7: White


.SH MODULES
.TP
.B clock
This is the default module, it displays the current time. The 'h' key
will switch between different decimal hint modes. 'a' key will switch 
between the two different display modes 'vertical' and 'horizontal'. Any
other key will quit.
.TP
.B chrono
This module will run a timer from 0 to whatever you need. You can press
the Spacebar at any time to pause the timer, and BackSpace to reset it. Any
other key will quit. This module has an extra binary line that shows tenth
of seconds, this might makes some slow terminal flicker. 'h' key will
switch on/off different reading helps, 'a' will switch between display
modes.
.TP
.B guessbin
This game displays a binary time and ask you its decimal equivalent. To
answer you have to fill the time in this form : "HH:MM:SS". The difficulty
only changes the answer delay and the amount of points you get. This module
is not affected by -f, -b or -H.
