tbclock (Tamentis Binary Clock)
===============================
This is a quick dirty little app to display a full screen binary clock
in your terminal (using curses). If you don't know how to read this,
just check out wikipedia for binary. It doesn't support resizing, there
is a few lines in the source to do that, but disabled ;) It is known to
work on Linux, OpenBSD and Darwin/Mac OSX, it's quite simple and should
work everywhere... It also feature a guessing game.
