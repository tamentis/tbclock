tbclock (Tamentis Binary Clock)
===============================
tbclock is a dirty little app that displays a full screen binary clock
in your terminal (using curses). It doesn't support resizing (yet). It
is quite simple and features modules like 'guessbin' a little game and
'chrono' a timer with tenth of seconds. It was a fun way to learn curses ;)

Installation
------------
make
make install

(Use gmake if you are using a non-gnu operating system)
